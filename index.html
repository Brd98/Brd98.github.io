    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>This is a personal blog were I want to post about projects I create (or contribute to), progress I make in studying cyber security and anything else I do in the field. Also, I am going to work on the site itself and post any the updates here.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I will keep the design of the site simple because I'm here to write and I'm not the greastest coder.</p>
