## Brief update on the blog

After putting off posting anything for about a month, I have finally come around to uploading something to this blog.
My plan is to create and maintain a regular upload schedule with blog posts to use as motivation for staying consistent in studying and any projects.

## OverTheWire Progress

So far, I have only completed levels up to Bandit Level 19 (I have put it off for a while as well) and recorded some of the progress:

**25/06/25**
- Completed Level 0 on Bandit - Connected to the host using SSH with the username and password provided, and located the password for Level 1.

- Completed Level 1 on Bandit - Had to go to Stack Overflow to find the command that allows me to read a file with a dashed filename (to get the password for Level 2).

- Completed Levels 2 to 9 with a friend later in the day - We both helped each other on different levels where we didn't have a solution, and these levels mainly revolved around needing to search for files or specific strings in large data sets to find the passwords. Also used ChatGPT for explaining commands.

**29/06/25**
 - Completed Levels 10 to 18 between now and the last update.
Used a few walkthroughs on levels due to complexity and had help from my friend.
