# Short term plan (now - end of 2025)

## Homelabbing
- Currently plan to set up virtual environments to practice red teaming.
- Hopefully will also be able to purchase a Raspberry Pi to set up a dedicated machine for labs, or even a small network as I already have some Cisco hardware.
(Additionally, for more networking practice I will either make do with my own hardware or use Cisco Packet Tracer to make larger and/or more complex networks).

## Certificates
- Started the Junior Cybersecurity Analyst on HTB academy (as its the first and cheapest cert available there) and plan to finish it before October 2025.
- Will also start on the CCNA certificate, and try having it complete before 2026.
(If time allows, I will try completing a third cert before the end of the year). 

## Programming
- Going to start learning C/C++ and get some basic projects under my belt (without vibe coding).

## CTFs
- In addition to OverTheWire, I will complete labs on HTB and THM for practice. 
- After a month or two of working on labs I will try joining a basic/beginner level team CTF event.

# Plans for 2026

## Hardware
- Either buy or make my own pwnagotchi and start other hardware projects (such as a simple RFID chip reader with a Rasberry Pi).

## Certificates
- Complete all other HTB certs, CompTIA Security+ and the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner - to get a foothold in cloud security.

## Programming
- Continue with C/C++ and pivot into GO or JavaScript.
